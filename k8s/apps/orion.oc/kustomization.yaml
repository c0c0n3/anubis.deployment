# Inflate Orchestra Cities' Orion chart and inject a sidecar into the
# deployment.
#
# Build with:
#
# $ cd nix
# $ nix shell
# $ cd ..
# $ kustomize build --enable-helm --load-restrictor LoadRestrictionsNone \
#             k8s/apps/orion.oc
# # ^ or: cd k8s/apps/orion &&
# #       kustomize build --enable-helm --load-restrictor LoadRestrictionsNone
#
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

# A Helm generator pulls down a Helm chart, renders the chart with any
# value files you specify and then makes the output YAML available to
# your Kustomize config to further tweak it.
#
# NOTE
# 1. Building with Helm generators. To use Helm generators you've got to
# pass the `--enable-helm` to the build command, e.g.
#
#     $ kustomize build --enable-helm k8s/apps/orion.oc
#
# This assumes Helm v3 is in your path but you can also tell the build
# command to use a specific Helm binary with the `--helm-command` flag.
# See
# - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/chart.md
#
# 2. `helmChartInflationGenerator`. That's the generator name you'll find
# in the official docs (retrieved Oct 2022)
# - https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/builtins/
# but it was actually deprecated in v4.1.0 in favour of `helmCharts`:
# - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv4.1.0
# The Helm example in the repo uses `helmCharts` too:
# _ https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/chart.md
#
# 3. Component patch not applied when using helmChart generator.
# So we've got a Kustomize issue (bug?) to spoil the Helm/Kustomize pipeline
# party. (See https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/4841)
# Our workaround is to reapply the sidecar's component patch to inject
# the Envoy container into the Deployment that comes out of Helm inflation.
# Notice our workaround needs this Kustomize flag
#   --load-restrictor LoadRestrictionsNone
# See note below.

patches:
# In our testbed, we don't need the init container the Helm chart generates.
- target:
    kind: Deployment
  path: remove-init-container.yaml
# The Envoy sidecar is configured to forward HTTP requests to `localhost:8080`.
# So we've got to start Orion on port 8080.
- target:
    kind: Deployment
  path: add-port-to-cmd.yaml
# We set the Helm chart's internal port to 8080 (helm-values.yaml) but the
# chart also puts that value in the Service's target port. That's not what
# we want since the Service should forward to Envoy which is on port 8181.
# We also set the Helm chart's service type to `NodePort` but the chart
# outputs a `clusterIP: None` which is invalid when using a node port.
# Finally, the `nodePort` field doesn't get set to 1026. So we fix all
# that.
- target:
    kind: Service
  path: fix-svc.yaml
# The sidecar component we brought in earlier correctly generates the
# config maps, but the patch to inject the Envoy container does **not**
# get applied. (Kustomize bug?) So we reapply it here. Notice we reference
# the original patch instead of copying the file over to this directory.
# (Best to keep away from copy-pasta if you can.) But b/c the patch comes
# from another dir, we've got to tell Kustomize to drop load restrictions
# with the flag: `--load-restrictor LoadRestrictionsNone`.

    kind: Deployment
