# A Helm generator pulls down a Helm chart, renders the chart with any
# value files you specify and then makes the output YAML available to
# your Kustomize config to further tweak it.
#
# NOTE
# 1. Building with Helm generators. To use Helm generators you've got to
# pass the `--enable-helm` to the build command, e.g.
#
#     $ kustomize build --enable-helm k8s/apps
#
# This assumes Helm v3 is in your path but you can also tell the build
# command to use a specific Helm binary with the `--helm-command` flag.
# See
# - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/chart.md
#
# 2. `helmChartInflationGenerator`. That's the generator name you'll find
# in the official docs (retrieved Oct 2022)
# - https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/builtins/
# but it was actually deprecated in v4.1.0 in favour of `helmCharts`:
# - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv4.1.0
# The Helm example in the repo uses `helmCharts` too:
# _ https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/chart.md

# At the moment, for sidecar injection to work there needs to be a "volumes"
# element in the deployment. So we add a dummy one just in case the Deployment
# that comes out after applying the values to the Helm chart does *not* have
# a "volumes" element. (If it does, our dummy one will be merged in, keeping
# whatever volumes came out of Helm.)

# In our testbed, we don't need the init container the Helm chart generates.
- target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: orion-orion
  path: remove-init-container.yaml
# The Envoy sidecar is configured to forward HTTP requests to `localhost:8080`.
# So we've got to start Orion on port 8080.
- target:
    kind: Deployment
    name: orion-orion
  path: add-port-to-cmd.yaml
# We set the Helm chart's internal port to 8080 (helm-values.yaml) but the
# chart also puts that value in the Service's target port. That's not what
# we want since the Service should forward to Envoy which is on port 8181.
# We also set the Helm chart's service type to `NodePort` but the chart
# outputs a `clusterIP: None` which is invalid when using a node port.
# Finally, the `nodePort` field doesn't get set to 1026. So we fix all
# that.
