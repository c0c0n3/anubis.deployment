# Inflate Orchestra Cities' Orion chart, tweak it and then inject a
# sidecar into the deployment.
#
# Build with:
#
# $ cd nix
# $ nix shell
# $ cd ..
# $ kustomize build --enable-helm k8s/apps/orion.oc
# # ^ or: cd k8s/apps/orion.oc && kustomize build --enable-helm
#
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

# We first have to inflate and tweak the chart, then inject the sidecar
# afterwards. Why not do everything with just one Kustomization? i.e.
# why not declare the `components` stanza in `app/kustomization.yaml`?
# Sadly, that's not possible b/c Kustomize processes components before
# generators---see the note about it in `k8s/test/helm/README.md`.
