# At the moment, for sidecar injection to work there needs to be a "volumes"
# element in the deployment. So we add a dummy one just in case the Deployment
# that comes out after applying the values to the Helm chart does *not* have
# a "volumes" element. (If it does, our dummy one will be merged in, keeping
# whatever volumes came out of Helm.)

# The Envoy sidecar is configured to forward HTTP requests to `localhost:8080`.
# So we've got to start Orion on port 8080.
